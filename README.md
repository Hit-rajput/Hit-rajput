# Hi there, I'm Hitesh 𓆉
### Machine Learning & Data Science Professional | Software Engineering Background

I enjoy building things with data — from research-driven machine learning projects to experimental visualizations that explore new ways of representing information.

This space is a collection of my academic work, personal projects, and ongoing research.

When I’m not working with data, you’ll probably find me hiking 🏔️ or swimming 🌊.

##  Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence
*Focus: Predictive Modeling, Computer Vision, Evolutionary Algorithms*

###  [Ishkode - Evolutionary Wildfire Prediction](https://github.com/hit-rajput/forest-fire-prediction) ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-In%20Progress-orange?style=flat-square)
**Tools:** `Python` `Genetic Algorithms` `KDTree` `Scikit-Learn`
A research initiative proposing a novel **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** to optimize feature selection for detecting "Mega-Fire" events in the Cariboo region.
* **Methodology:** Implemented **KDTree spatial indexing** to accurately merge satellite fire perimeters with ERA5 weather station data.
* **Key Innovation:** Moves beyond standard classification to handle high-imbalance datasets (rare extreme events).

###  [Hybrid Facial Emotion Recognition (FER)](https://github.com/hit-rajput/sentiment_analysis)
**Tools:** `Python` `TensorFlow/Keras` `OpenCV` `MATLAB`
A hybrid computer vision system classifying 7 distinct human emotions with superior robustness to lighting changes.
* **Innovation:** Integrated **CNNs** with manual feature descriptors (**HOG + SIFT**) to stabilize learning curves.
* **Outcome:** Outperformed standard CNN baselines on the CK+ dataset by capturing local geometric facial features.
  
###  [Colour Separation Using Evolutionary Algorithms For Forensic Images ](https://github.com/Hit-rajput/Project-Atisan)
**Tools:** `matlab` `Genetic algorithms` `MATLAB`
This project presents an innovative approach to forensic image analysis, focusing on the challenge of color separation in complex images. It explores the use of evolutionary algorithms to enhance the clarity and distinctness of visual information, which is crucial in forensic investigations and legal proceedings.

## 📊 Data Visualization & Analytics
*Focus: Business Analysis, Dashboarding, KPI Tracking, Data Storytelling*

###  [Global Gaming Market Analysis (1980-2016)](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hitesh.rajputh/viz/global_sales_distribution_Rideline/GLobalSalesDistribution)
**Tools:** `Tableau` `Ridgeline Plots` `Contextual Filtering` `UX/UI Design`
A technical exploration of industry dominance, featuring custom-built **Ridgeline Plots** and **Packed Bubble Charts** to visualize the market share of key publishers.

![Global Gaming Market](Ridge_plot.gif)

* **The Challenge:** Standard charts often fail to show individual trajectories against a global backdrop effectively.
* **The Solution (Contextual Filtering):** Engineered a complex hover interaction where interacting with the ridgeline distribution automatically filters the bottom Area Chart. This allows users to instantly compare a specific publisher's lifecycle (e.g., Nintendo's Wii-era spike) against total global sales volume in real-time.

###  [Canadian Forest Fire Analytics (Tableau Story)](https://public.tableau.com/views/CanadianForestFIres/FInalStory?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
**Tools:** `Tableau` `Data Cleaning` `Geospatial Analysis`
A comprehensive data story identifying the trends using 10+ years of historical data.

![Tableau Story Overview](Dashboard_final.gif)

* **Interactive Animation:** Engineered an **animation-based geospatial map** that visualizes the velocity and density of fire spread throughout the year, allowing stakeholders to pinpoint peak risk windows.
* **Analyst Insight:** Correlated lightning-caused fires with higher intensity/area burned compared to human-caused fires, influencing resource allocation strategies for remote regions.

###  [Global Console Game Sales Intelligence (Tableau)](https://public.tableau.com/views/Game_console/Story1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
**Tools:** `Tableau` `Statistical Analysis` `Market Segmentation`
A deep-dive strategic dashboard exploring market dynamics across genres, platforms, and publishers (1980–2015).
