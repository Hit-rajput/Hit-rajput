## 🧠 Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence

### 🌲 Predictive Wildfire Modeling with Evolutionary Algorithms
**Tags:** `Python` `Genetic Algorithms` `Predictive Modeling` `Research`

An ongoing research initiative to improve fire risk forecasting in Canada. I am currently mimicking established methodology to conduct an exploratory data analysis of forest fires specifically in the **Cariboo Fire Centre (BC)**.

* [cite_start]**The Tech:** Combining standard ML models with Genetic Algorithms to optimize prediction accuracy[cite: 13, 49].
* **The Innovation:** Moving beyond simple regression to use evolutionary computing for optimizing complex environmental variables.
* [cite_start]**Impact:** Recognized by professors and invited to co-author a research paper on the methodology[cite: 48].

### 🎭 Facial Expression Recognition (CNN + Handcrafted Features)
**Tags:** `Deep Learning` `CNN` `Computer Vision` `HOG/SIFT`

Designed a hybrid computer vision model to tackle emotion recognition in unconstrained environments.

* **The Challenge:** Standard CNNs often struggle with varying lighting and subtle expression changes.
* [cite_start]**The Solution:** Engineered a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) augmented with handcrafted features (HOG and SIFT) to capture texture and shape information that pure deep learning might miss[cite: 57, 58].
* [cite_start]**Outcome:** Significantly improved robustness and accuracy across diverse lighting conditions[cite: 59].

## 📊 Data Visualization & Analytics

### 🇨🇦 Canadian Forest Fire Analytics Dashboard
**Tags:** `Tableau` `Data Cleaning` `Historical Analysis` `Interactive Dashboards`

A comprehensive interactive dashboard visualizing over two decades of wildfire data (2001–2024).

* **Objective:** Transform raw environmental data into an accessible tool for analyzing fire trends across Canadian regions, with a recent focus on the Cariboo Region.
* **Key Features:**
    * Temporal analysis of fire frequency and severity.
    * [cite_start]Geospatial mapping of fire hotspots[cite: 45].
* **View Project:** [Link to Tableau Public] ---

## ☁️ Cloud & Software Engineering

### 🕵️‍♂️ Forensic Image Color Separation (Hackathon Finalist)
**Tags:** `Google Cloud Platform` `React` `Microservices` `MATLAB` `REST APIs`

[cite_start]*Finalist Project - Intelliswift i-nnovate Hackathon (North America)* [cite: 52]

A cloud-native application designed to isolate and enhance specific color elements in low-quality forensic images.

* **Architecture:**
    * [cite_start]**Frontend:** React-based web application for user interaction[cite: 9].
    * [cite_start]**Backend:** A MATLAB microservice hosted on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** performing complex evolutionary algorithms[cite: 55, 56].
* [cite_start]**My Role:** I engineered the orchestration of API calls between the frontend and the GCP backend, ensuring scalable deployment and seamless user experience[cite: 10].
* [cite_start]**Outcome:** Recognized among top teams in North America for innovative use of evolutionary algorithms in forensics[cite: 88].

### 📱 Production Engineering at Advance Infotech
**Tags:** `Google Firebase` `Authentication` `Mobile Development`

During my tenure as a Software Developer, I focused on building robust back-end integrations for mobile and web solutions.

* [cite_start]**Key Work:** Managed Google Firebase databases and implemented secure Google Auth APIs to handle user data for local business applications[cite: 14, 77].
