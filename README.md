## 🧠 Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence
*Focus: Predictive Modeling, Computer Vision, Evolutionary Algorithms*

### 🌲 [Ishkode - Evolutionary Wildfire Prediction](https://github.com/hit-rajput/forest-fire-prediction) ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-In%20Progress-orange?style=flat-square)
**Tools:** `Python` `Genetic Algorithms` `KDTree` `Scikit-Learn`
A research initiative proposing a novel **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** to optimize feature selection for detecting "Mega-Fire" events in the Cariboo region.
* **Methodology:** Implemented **KDTree spatial indexing** to accurately merge satellite fire perimeters with ERA5 weather station data.
* **Key Innovation:** Moves beyond standard classification to handle high-imbalance datasets (rare extreme events).

### 🎭 [Hybrid Facial Emotion Recognition (FER)](https://github.com/hit-rajput/sentiment_analysis)
**Tools:** `Python` `TensorFlow/Keras` `OpenCV` `MATLAB`
A hybrid computer vision system classifying 7 distinct human emotions with superior robustness to lighting changes.
* **Innovation:** Integrated **CNNs** with manual feature descriptors (**HOG + SIFT**) to stabilize learning curves.
* **Outcome:** Outperformed standard CNN baselines on the CK+ dataset by capturing local geometric facial features.

## 📊 Data Visualization & Analytics
*Focus: Business Analysis, Dashboarding, KPI Tracking, Data Storytelling*

### 🌲 [Canadian Forest Fire Analytics (Tableau Story)](https://public.tableau.com/views/CanadianForestFIres/FInalStory?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
**Tools:** `Tableau` `Data Cleaning` `Geospatial Analysis`
A comprehensive data story identifying the trends using 10+ years of historical data.

![Tableau Story Overview](Dashboard_final.gif)

* **Interactive Animation:** Engineered an **animation-based geospatial map** that visualizes the velocity and density of fire spread throughout the year, allowing stakeholders to pinpoint peak risk windows.
* **Analyst Insight:** Correlated lightning-caused fires with higher intensity/area burned compared to human-caused fires, influencing resource allocation strategies for remote regions.

### 🎮 [Global Console Game Sales Intelligence (Tableau)](https://public.tableau.com/views/Game_console/Story1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
**Tools:** `Tableau` `Statistical Analysis` `Market Segmentation`
A deep-dive strategic dashboard exploring market dynamics across genres, platforms, and publishers (1980–2015). This project utilizes descriptive statistics to uncover sales drivers in the NA, EU, and Global markets.

| Analytical Dimension | Key Analyst Responsibilities & Insights |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Genre Trends** | **Trend Analysis:** Mapped the rise and fall of genre popularity over 35 years, identifying the "Action" genre as a consistent high-performer while "Puzzle" games showed declining market share. |
| **Platform Wars** | **Performance Benchmarking:** Evaluated the lifecycle success of top 3 platforms, visualizing the "Console War" dominance shifts to inform platform-exclusive content strategies. |
| **Regional Harmony** | **Correlation Analysis:** Discovered a strong linear correlation ("Linear Harmony") between NA and EU sales markets, suggesting unified marketing campaigns are effective for these regions. |
| **Publisher Impact** | **Market Share Analysis:** Quantified the relative impact of top 10 titles on overall publisher revenue, highlighting reliance on "Blockbuster" hits versus steady portfolio performance. |

### 🩸 [Supply Risk Monitor (Power BI)]() ![Status](https://github.com/Hit-rajput/blood-supply-risk-monitor)
**Tools:** `Power BI` `Predictive Risk Modeling` `Forecasting`
A prescriptive analytics system forecasting trauma-driven blood demand against donor supply capacity.
* **Goal:** Shifts healthcare logistics from descriptive reporting to prescriptive risk modeling.
* **Key Question:** "Given forecasted weather conditions and historical donor patterns, what is the probability of a supply deficit?"
* **Feature:** Visualizes the gap between projected trauma demand (from motor vehicle collisions) and donor availability to trigger proactive alerts.
