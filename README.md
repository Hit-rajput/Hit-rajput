## 🧠 Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence
*Focus: Predictive Modeling, Computer Vision, Evolutionary Algorithms*

### 🌲 [Ishkode - Evolutionary Wildfire Prediction](https://github.com/hit-rajput/forest-fire-prediction)
**Tools:** `Python` `Genetic Algorithms` `KDTree` `Scikit-Learn`
A research initiative proposing a novel **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** to optimize feature selection for detecting "Mega-Fire" events in the Cariboo region.
* **Methodology:** Implemented **KDTree spatial indexing** to accurately merge satellite fire perimeters with ERA5 weather station data.
* **Key Innovation:** Moves beyond standard classification to handle high-imbalance datasets (rare extreme events).

### 🎭 [Hybrid Facial Emotion Recognition (FER)](https://github.com/hit-rajput/sentiment_analysis)
**Tools:** `Python` `TensorFlow/Keras` `OpenCV` `MATLAB`
A hybrid computer vision system classifying 7 distinct human emotions with superior robustness to lighting changes.
* **Innovation:** Integrated **CNNs** with manual feature descriptors (**HOG + SIFT**) to stabilize learning curves.
* **Outcome:** Outperformed standard CNN baselines on the CK+ dataset by capturing local geometric facial features.

## 📊 Data Visualization & Analytics
*Focus: Business Analysis, Dashboarding, KPI Tracking, Data Storytelling*

### 🌲 [Canadian Forest Fire Analytics (Tableau Story)](https://public.tableau.com/views/CanadianForestFIres/FInalStory?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
**Tools:** `Tableau` `Data Cleaning` `Trend Analysis`
A comprehensive data story visualizing 20+ years of wildfire data to identify the "Flash Drought" anomaly of 2017.
* **Business Value:** Transforms complex meteorological data into an accessible narrative for stakeholders, highlighting risk factors in the Cariboo region.
* **Key Insight:** Visualized the decoupling of fire intensity from traditional weather metrics due to the Mountain Pine Beetle infestation.

### 📈 [Retail/Sales Performance Dashboard (Power BI)]()
*Coming Soon*
**Tools:** `Power BI` `DAX` `Data Modeling`
An interactive dashboard designed to track daily sales performance, regional growth, and customer churn.
* **Feature:** Drill-down capabilities for granular product analysis.
